Testing the code generation with the free copilot from github website

Prompt:

**Hi Copilot! Could you generate a simple Pong game utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? The player should control the left paddle with their mouse, and the right paddle should be controlled automatically by a basic AI. Make sure the game includes a bouncing ball and collision detection for paddles and walls. Please provide the code for all three components: the HTML file, the CSS file, and the JavaScript file directly within the chat window. Thanks!**
